1. giving 5 min window for contract to complete
    smart contract need to triggered after a room is booked by a customer to check if hotel confirmed
    his/her booking, bcz it may  happen hotel didmt pay intentionally or unintentially

    triggering smart contract evenry 5 min can be done by hotel backend side but i.e gonna be risky as we after
    dependent on hotel

    we decided to trigger smart contracts every five minutes by another service only doing this job 
    and is independent of any hotel

    triggering opertion may consume gas so, we are making it a view function to check if any pending
    contract need to be cancelled in which hotel didnt pay in 5 minutes

    if count of pending contracts not completed is >0 then a gas cnsuming transaction is perfomed
    to deleted the contracts

    contracts array will not get flooded as in 100,00,00 booking bcz atleast one is not completed by hotel
    then contract array will be updated

2. customer should pay first bcz paying gets gas fee involeved, if hotel pays first then customer may
    cancel it and hotel gas fee will be losed and customer can do it again and again

3. hotels will not do this kind of activity often as they want their room to be booked
    and in future version we can also keep track of their ratings on basis of their performance
